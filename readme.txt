== Description ==
Campus Explorer is a free service that helps all types of students find the schools which best match their higher education needs. One of the ways this happens is through the Campus Explorer Widget.

This plugin is designed to allow partners of Campus Explorer to get up and running quickly with the Campus Explorer Widget. Instead of using the html embed code, which sometimes gets modified by the WYSIWYG editor, this plugin takes advantage of native Wordpress features-- the widget and the shortcode, for adding the Campus Explorer Widget.

This plugin is designed to allow partners of the Campus Explorer Widget to get up and running quickly.

= How do I use this widget? =

First, make sure you are signed up as a Campus Explorer Partner. See next question for more information on that.

Enter your source code at Settings > Campus Explorer (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=campusexplorer_settings) and hit "Save Settings".

Now you can start configuring widgets at Appearance > Widgets. Find the Campus Explorer widget and drag it to a Widget Area. Update settings (or leave blank for default values) and hit save.

Or you can create a shortcode at Settings > Campus Explorer > Shortcode Builder. The shortcode without any custom settings is, you guessed it, [campusexplorer]. Enter custom texts and area of study and concentration if you need a more customized experience.

= Wait, I don't have a source code. Where do I get one? =
